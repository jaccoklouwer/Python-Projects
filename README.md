# Python-Projects

## FlaskBlog
the flaskBlog was my way of learning `Flask`.

##How to start the application.

First you have to install all the requirements with:
<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

After that you can either run the application with 
<code>python run.py</code>
Or you can set the `FLASK_APP` variable to the `run.py` file. 

On linux:
<code>export FLASK_APP=run.py</code>

On Windows:
<code>set FLASK_APP=run.py</code>
